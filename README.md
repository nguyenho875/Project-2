### ECE-218: Embedded Microcontroller System
### Project 2: Enhanced Car Alarm and Automatic Headlight Control System
### Team Members: Hoang Tran and Nguyen Ho

Our project aims to enhance and implement two car subsystems, ignition alarm and automatic headlight control.

#### Igniton Subsystem
The ignition subsystem should be able to welcome the driver once the seat is occupied, then check if both seats are filled and seatbelts fastened to allow engine startup. If the car is ignited when these conditions aren’t met, the system triggers an alarm and displays a message listing the violations. Buttons are used to represent contacts provided from the seat occupancy and seatbelt sensors as well as the ignition push button. We also used green and blue LEDs to represent the car lights that indicate when ignition is enabled and when the engine has started. The serial terminal on the PC acts as the car’s display monitor, necessary for the welcome and error messages, and a buzzer is used as the vehicle’s alarm that sounds when an error occurs.
