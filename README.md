## ECE-218: Embedded Microcontroller System
## Project 2: Enhanced Car Alarm and Automatic Headlight Control System
## Team Members: Hoang Tran and Nguyen Ho

Our project aims to enhance and implement two car subsystems, ignition alarm and automatic headlight control.

### Igniton Subsystem
The ignition subsystem should be able to welcome the driver once the seat is occupied, then check if both seats are filled and seatbelts fastened, all conditions of which are represented by buttons, to allow engine startup. If the car is ignited (by pressing the ignition button) when these conditions aren’t met, the system triggers an alarm and displays a message listing the violations. The serial terminal on the PC acts as the car’s display monitor,  and a buzzer is used as the vehicle’s alarm that sounds when an error occurs. 


### Headlight Subsystem
The driver controls the car's headlight using a mode selector represented by a potentiometer. There are 3 modes to the selector, ON to always turn on both headlights, OFF to always turn them off, and AUTO to turn them on and off depending on the brightness sensed by a light sensor.
